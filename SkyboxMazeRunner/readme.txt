Maze game using DirectXTK
==========================
Author: Alex Kabak


Troubleshooting
------------------
if you cannot build, check to ensure the project has the DirectXTK package (this should be a folder called "Packages" located in the same folder as the solution).
If the package is missing, it can be recovered by going into Visual Studio -> Project -> Manage NuGet Packages -> Browse;
search for "DirectXTK" and select and install "directxtk_desktop_2015"
